# Creating a Commando command (Discord.JS) (Part 1)

In this chapter, we will create a command for our Discord.JS Commando Bot.

But first, you need to check that you have already filled in the details inside the [config.json](../sources/config.json) file.

If you are done, you can already start on this chapter!

> <b>Note:</b> You can view the Discord.JS Documentation here for better knowledge understanding of Discord.JS Library. I have also created the `docs` command to refer to the Discord.JS Documentation on Discord.<br>
