# <b>MongoDB Installation</b>

This chapter will show you on how to install MongoDB as a database.

> <b>Note:</b> I recommend you using `Google Cloud Platform (GCP)` to create an Ubuntu Server to install MongoDB.

MongoDB stores a database in JSON-like format, not like other open-source databases such as `MySQL` and `SQLite3`, so it is easier for us to understand when reading the data on text.

To get started, create a `Ubuntu Server VM Instance` in `GCP`. Then, login to to that Ubuntu Server through `Secure Shell Hash (SSH)`.

Once you are done, create a user for the MongoDB server. But first, let's login as root.

```terminal
$ sudo -s
# adduser <your_username>
```

Remember to change `<your_username>` to the `username` you want to create.

Fill in the details required.

Next, we moderate that user to the `Super User Do (sudo)` group:

```terminal
# usermod -aG sudo <your_username>
```

So we finished creating the user! Now let's login.
```terminal
$ ssh <your_username>@<your_server_ip>
```

Then, we import the public GPG key for the latest stable version of MongoDB by running this command:

```terminal
$ curl -fsSL https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.4.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```
